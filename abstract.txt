The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments have verified the predictions of the highly-successful Standard Model (SM). However, the SM  lacks an explanation for several observed phenomena (e.g. dark matter) motivating the search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. The current BSM search strategy uses simplified BSM models (i.e. models with 2-5 parameters) to design BSM search regions. This simplified approach was driven by enhanced BSM physics sensitivity from the large increases of center-of-mass energies during early LHC upgrades. Future LHC upgrades, however, will no longer include significant increases in energy, but will first double (Run~3) and then tenfold (High Luminosity-LHC, HL-LHC) the the current data set.

The HL-LHC comes with challenges, specifically two challenges faced by ATLAS are the need to probe regions in the far reaches of the large data set for BSM physics discovery and the computational requirements needed to produce large amounts of accurate SM background simulations to allow for background estimation in these regions of the data. This proposal presents the development of machine learning (ML) algorithms to both systematically search for BSM physics and to enable accurate background simulations. The increase in High Performance Computing (HPC) resources (such as the upcoming Aurora supercomputer for which the PI is leading an early access proposal) yields a unique opportunity for facing these computational challenges.
